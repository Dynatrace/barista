# Releasing

A new version of the Angular components is released at least once at the end of each sprint. If there are fixes and features ready earlier, a release in the middle of a sprint is also possible.

[Breaking changes](***REMOVED*** are released with the next (future) major version.

## How to release
**Note: Releasing should only be done by the maintainers of the angular-components.**

Go to the [pull request overview page](***REMOVED*** of the angular-components repository and merge all pull requests marked as `[merge-ready]` into master. Only merge pull requests marked with `[major]` when releasing a new major version. Once all branches are merged and all merge conflicts are resolved, follow these steps:

* Check out and update your local `master` branch.
* If you wanna do a major release run `yarn  breaking-changes` which will get you a list of breaking changes for the next major version. If you do have breaking changes for the release version or have deprecations:
  * Create a branch for applying the breaking changes for this release version, e.g. `fix/apply-breaking-changes-4.0.0`.
  * Apply the breaking changes of the major version you want to release and remove deprecations.
  * Commit the breaking changes in related chunks. Add a `BREAKING CHANGE` label (all uppercase) in the commit message!
  * Push the commits and create a pull request.
  * When merged continue with the release. (Make sure you are on the updated `master` branch again.)
* Start the release wizard by entering `yarn stage-release` in your command line tool.
* The wizard will now prompt you for the new version number. You can select between a `patch`, `minor` and `major` release. The wizard will also recommend you the new version number based on the commits between now and the last release.
* Based on the version you have selected, a new release-stage branch will be created (e.g. `release-stage/2.0.0`) and the new version will be set in the `package.json`.
* A changelog based on the commits will be created and attached to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
* Review the `CHANGELOG.md` file and ensure that the log contains only changes that apply to the public library release. Move commits marked with `BREAKING CHANGE` to an extra "Breaking changes" section on top. When done, proceed by confirming the prompt in your command line tool.
* The new changelog and the version bump will automatically be commited, and pushed to the remote repository.
* Create a new pull request from this branch against the master branch.
* Once all required tests in the pull request have successfully been run and you have clicked the merge button, this version will be released.
* Create a tag for the version bump commit by running `yarn create-tag`.

## After the release

After a successful release the Barista examples (code demos) build is triggered and the updated content for the design system is built. Check the pull request that is automatically opened in the [barista-content repository](***REMOVED*** and the generated preview. When merging this pull request all updates to component demos and the [new changelog](***REMOVED*** will be published in [Barista](***REMOVED***

Announce the new version upgrade in our Slack channels [#help-ng-components](***REMOVED***) and [#news-ui-dev](***REMOVED***) following this pattern:
